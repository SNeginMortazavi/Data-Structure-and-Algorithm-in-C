Tic Tac Toe Game

You will be required to implement several functions in a Tic Tac Toe game. I have already implemented the main that will call the functions you have to write. The board will be stored in a 2 dimensional 3x3 array. For this assignment you do not get to choose your data structure.

You are required to implement the following functions:

createBoard – This function will create a 3x3 array and return the pointer to it.
toChar – This function will convert the values of the enum to its equivalent character.
getBoardDisplay – This function will return a string that represents the entire board with the current status of the board.
markTheBoard – This function marks the board based on the position and marker passed in.
hasWon – Tells if the marker of the player passed in as won the game.
isTie – Tells if the board is currently a tie.
